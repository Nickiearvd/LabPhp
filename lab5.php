Why do we use GIT repositories ?
Git repositories enable us to share code with others in a easy way. If you only want to show your code to someone else, it's easier to send a link of your git repository than send all your code. The receiver will be able to look at your code without need of download it and without be able to make any change on it unless you give him this ability in the settings.

Use Git repositories in project help us to share code in one click. You don't need to compress the project and send it etc. With Git, you only need to update the repository in the Github desktop. Even if two people can't work on the same file, because it will overwrite it, you still can work on two different files in a same project. For example if I am working on the header and an other people is working on the homepage. Since these two files are linked, if I make any changes in the header, the other person, by refreshing his desktop, will automatically get my changes.

The usage of REST API's is to help the communication between different types of lectures. Each devices, like computer, tv etc can use different platforms and it help them communicate by translating the code. It also help the user to get, create, update and erase information from the database.
In our project, Rest api's is helpful since we want our user to be enable to create his own drinks and share them. Of course we will also make him enable to update it or erase it.
